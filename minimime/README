0. Requirements

All you'll need is a C compiler (preferably GCC since I think I used some
GNU specific stuff in at least some of the macros) and standard libraries.
MiniMIME does not have any external dependencies. It should compile and
run cleanly on any (nearly) POSIX-compliant system.

1. What's it?

MiniMIME is a library that provides a programmer friendly API for parsing
and constructing MIME messages. The following RFCs are implemented:

	RFC 2045: MIME Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies
	RFC 2046: MIME Part Two: Media Types
	RFC 2049: MIME Part Five: Conformance Criteria and Examples

It is intended to be as liberate as possible for incoming data while being as
strict as possible for constructed data.
