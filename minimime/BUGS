Known bugs in MiniMIME

* MiniMIME is yet unable to parse content type parameters which contain
  certain tspecials ("=" and ";") in it's value.

* The grammar parsing should really be done with some sophisticated parser,
  tool like yacc, instead of the way it is done now.

* There are quite a couple of things to do. Read TODO in this package for
  more informations. Also, there are surely items to do that are not on the
  TODO list.
