Known bugs in MiniMIME

* Reentrance. The current implementation using yacc does not allow for
  reentrant parsing. Maybe using GNU bison and the %pure_parser option
  would be a solution. I will have a look into this option. Also, I don't
  know for sure about flex. Experience, anyone?

* There are quite a couple of things to do. Read TODO in this package for
  more informations. Also, there are surely items to do that are not on the
  TODO list.
