A library to parse and construct MIME messages
</p>
<h2>What is MiniMIME?</h2>
<p>
<i>MiniMIME</i> is a shared library designed to parse and construct MIME
(RFCs <a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2045.html">2045</a>,
<a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2046.html">2046</a>,
<a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2047.html">2047</a>
<a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2048.html">2048</a> and
<a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2049.html">2049</a>)
messages. It provides an easy to use API for C programms. It's ultimate
goal is to be as MIME conformant as possible -- which mean for us, it is
tolerant in which input it accepts (if wanted) and as correct as possible
when it comes to sending messages.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Since MiniMIME (as the name already tells) is designed with minimalism in
thoughts, all you will need is a POSIX compliant system, a C compiler and
a POSIX compliant libc. There are no external dependencies required.
