MiniMIME Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: Why don't you use GNU autotools for configuring/compiling/installing the
   library?

A: Have you ever seen how much bloat those tools add? For example, MiniMIME
   source code and all files are about 233K in size. After GNUification with
   autoconf and friends, we have slightly above 2M (!) of data in the source
   package. This is just too much.


Q: Are there any plans to have C++ wrapper classes for MiniMIME?

A: Yes. As soon as MiniMIME is in a usable state, I will begin to write C++
   abstraction classes for it.
   

Q: Why a MIME library in first place? Aren't there enough already?

A: I have seen several. Most are for C++ and purely object oriented, which is
   not acceptable for me, since I needed a MIME implementation for a pure C
   project. The ones I have seen for C (like gmime) have either unacceptable
   dependencies (glib), unacceptable licenses (GPL) or a horrible API (not to
   say that my API would be better, but it suits my needs more :).
